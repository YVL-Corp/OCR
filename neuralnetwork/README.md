# Neural network 

> [!NOTE]
> This part was made by **Tristan Druart**.

## Overview

This project is a simple neural network implemented in C. It is designed to demonstrate the network's ability to learn and compute basic binary logic operations, including:

  * AND
  * OR
  * XOR
  * NAND
  * XNOR

## Building

To compile the program, run the following command from the project's root directory:

```bash
make
```

This will create an executable file named `output`.

## Usage

Once compiled, you can execute the program by running:

```bash
./output
```

And clean the workspace by running:

```bash
make clean
```
